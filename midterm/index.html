    <h1>Gothic Architecture</h1>
    <div class="info">
        <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; line-height: 1.6; font-family: Montserrat;">Originating in northern France, Gothic Architecture evolved from Romanesque architecture and was popular in Europe from the late 12th to 16th century, during the High and Late Middle Ages. Characterized by pointed arches (most likely borrowed from Islamic architecture), ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and stained glass windows, the greatest number of surviving Gothic architectural buildings are churches, from smaller chapels to the largest cathedrals. While the term <span style="font-style: italic">Gothic </span> was originally to describe the supposedly barbarous style, it is now used to describe the worldâ€™s most majestic and iconic buildings.</p>
