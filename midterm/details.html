    <p>Gothic Architecture was prevalent in the 12th and 16th century during the High and Late Middle Ages. It originated in the ÃŽle-de-France and Picardy regions of northern France. The term "Gothic Architecture" was originally derogatory, given by Italian Renaissance writers, specifically Giorgio Vasari, who viewed the style as "barbaric" in contrast to the more refined and sophisticated classic styles of architecture. The Goths were a Germanic tribe known for sacking as well as contributing to the downfall of the Roman Empire. Gothic architecture evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture, but a series of Gothic revivals began in mid-18th century England and continued, largely for churches and university buildings, into the 20th century.</p>
